The .ipynb files in this directory contain the code that was developed to retrieve the data necessary to plot the graphs presented in the parent directory. 

The propublica_scraping_cleaning.ipynb file contains the code that was used to retrieve the relevant information from the Propublica API; the data was then saved in cleaned_propublica_data.csv. The biography_congress_scraping_cleaning.ipynb file contains the code that was used to scrape the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, and that data was then saved in congress_final.csv. 

The code presented in Data_visualisation.ipynb was used to merge those two datasets, which was then saved as Final_complete_dataset.csv. The plots presented in the parent directory originate from this merged data.
